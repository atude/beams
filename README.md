Beams is a suburb analysis webapp that merges housing market data and suburb information from a variety of sources to create a user friendly and intuitive hub. This can be used to influence decisions on buying properties by finding suburbs which best matches your criteria.

API's used include Domain.com, Google Places/Autocomplete, DeepAI, GNews, and several others.

This was built using a React.js framework using node.js and Express for back-end, and a HTML/CSS/MaterialReact front-end.
